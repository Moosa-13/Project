![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e8f9b2-a25f-4053-9bc3-a7c58e8478f8)

A simple start-up page I made for my firefox browser. Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/1fxsjzl/firefox_is_truly_the_best_browser/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

## Do this:
Try it [out](https://moosa-13.github.io/Project/).
Type help and press enter. This will list out some comands you can try.

## How to use?
If you want this as your start-up page,
* clone the repo
* go to firefox settings > Home
* select custom url instead of firefox default
* give path to index file. (eg. file:///home/user/startup/index.html)
* Tip - Go to script.js, search fo Moosa-13 and replace with your github name if you want it to show your github.
* Also change rmr13 to your username.
